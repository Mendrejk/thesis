[[MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES TO HISTORIC MUSIC RESTORATION.pdf]]

## Abstract: 
The thesis presents machine learning approaches to restore the poor-quality 1889 recording of Johannes Brahms playing his "Hungarian Dance No. 1" on piano. Digital signal processing is paired with two machine learning techniques: non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep neural networks (DNNs). The results show the advantages and disadvantages compared to a benchmark restoration of the same recording. The machine learning approaches provide restoration potential for a wide range of historic music artifacts with minimal overhead.

## Article Summary:
The thesis explores using NMF and DNNs to restore the damaged Brahms piano recording from 1889. For NMF, prior information about the piano and noise sources is encoded in the basis vectors. Various supervised and semi-supervised NMF approaches are evaluated. The best NMF approach uses semi-supervised NMF that learns the noise basis vectors while restricting the piano activations.

For the DNN approach, a deep recurrent neural network model is built based on an existing supervised source separation architecture. The model is trained on synthesized mixtures of clean piano and noise excerpts. Different data augmentation techniques and hyperparameters are experimented with to improve performance over the baseline.

Detailed evaluations are performed on the NMF and DNN approaches, comparing them to the original damaged recording and a benchmark restoration. A small-scale blind test is also conducted.

## Conclusions:
The machine learning approaches explored do not match the quality of the benchmark restoration, as they remove too much of the piano compared to the benchmark which preserves it all. However, the NMF approach offers a slight advantage by using high-quality piano basis vectors which provide clearer onsets and a sense of what Brahms' playing would sound like on a modern piano.

The DNN approach performs well at denoising but doesn't enhance the piano sound quality. Possible future work could incorporate phase information in addition to magnitude spectra in the DNN.

In summary, while not surpassing the benchmark, the machine learning approaches enable quicker restoration of historical recordings with less manual effort compared to classical methods. With further refinement, they have potential to aid in uncovering and restoring more old recordings.
