[[Stochastic Restoration of Heavily Compressed Musical Audio Using Generative Adversarial Networks.pdf]]

## Abstract Summary:
The article presents a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for stochastic restoration of high-quality musical audio signals from heavily compressed MP3 versions. The goal is to assess if 1) the model outputs improve the MP3 input quality, 2) the stochastic generator can produce samples closer to the original compared to a deterministic generator, and 3) the stochastic generator outputs are generally higher quality than deterministic baselines. Objective metrics and listening tests are used for evaluation.

## Overall Article Summary:
The authors developed a GAN model to restore high-quality audio from low-bitrate MP3 files. They trained stochastic and deterministic generator models on 16, 32 and 64 kbit/s MP3s. The model operates on the complex STFT spectrogram of the audio. Key architectural choices include self-gating convolutional layers to reduce memory usage, and "frequency aggregation filters" to better model non-local frequency correlations important in audio. A regularization loss encourages the random noise input to influence the generated output, preventing mode collapse. An extensive objective evaluation is performed using metrics like log-spectral distance, mean squared error, PEAQ scores, and SNR. A subjective listening test is also conducted to assess Mean Opinion Scores. 

## Conclusions Summary:
The restorations of 16 and 32 kbit/s MP3s are generally better than the MP3 inputs in both objective metrics and listening tests. The stochastic generator is able to output samples that are closer to the original than the deterministic generator. However, random samples from the stochastic generator are not rated significantly better than the deterministic outputs in the listening test.

The model successfully adds meaningful high frequency content for some sources like percussive sounds, consonants in vocals, and guitar sounds. But it struggles with more harmonic content. Future work could focus the training data, switch to complex-valued networks, and explore alternative audio representations. Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of GANs for musical audio enhancement from heavily compressed inputs.
