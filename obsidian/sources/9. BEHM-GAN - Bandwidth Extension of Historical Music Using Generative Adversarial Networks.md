[[BEHM-GAN - Bandwidth Extension of Historical Music Using Generative Adversarial Networks.pdf]]

## Abstract
Audio bandwidth extension aims to expand the spectrum of bandlimited audio signals. Although this topic has been broadly studied during recent years, the particular problem of **extending the bandwidth of historical music recordings remains an open challenge**. This paper proposes a **method for the bandwidth extension of historical music using generative adversarial networks (BEHM-GAN)** as a practical solution to this problem. The proposed method works with the complex spectrogram representation of audio and, thanks to a dedicated regularization strategy, can effectively extend the bandwidth of out-of-distribution real historical recordings. The BEHM-GAN is designed to be applied as a second step after denoising the recording to **suppress any additive disturbances, such as clicks and background noise**. We train and evaluate the method using solo piano classical music. The proposed method outperforms the compared baselines in both objective and subjective experiments. The results of a formal blind listening test show that **BEHM-GAN significantly increases the perceptual sound quality in early-20th-century gramophone recordings**. For several items, there is a substantial improvement in the mean opin- ion score after enhancing historical recordings with the proposed bandwidth-extension algorithm. This study represents a relevant step toward data-driven music restoration in real-world scenarios

## VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes the BEHM-GAN, a method to extend the bandwidth of historical music. The proposed method is **based on a generative adversarial network** and combines a time-frequency-domain generator with multiple time-domain discriminators. The BEHM-GAN is trained in a **self-supervised fashion using lowpass filters to simulate the bandwidth limitation of old recordings**. With the intention of strengthening the robustness of our model, we **regularize the training by randomizing the cutoff frequency of the filters and perturbing the filtered signal with a small amount of Gaussian white noise**. The trained generator is designed to be incorporated as the second step in a music restoration pipeline, where the first step is a deep music denoiser [17]. This is, to the best of our knowledge, **the first successful work that extends the bandwidth of historical music recordings**. The proposed method is evaluated using solo piano music, with objective and subjective metrics. As we show in App. B, the BEHM-GAN can also be applied to other types of music, such as orchestral music or string ensembles. However, this implies retraining the model with specialized data, as our **attempts to train the BEHM-GAN with a broader range of music resulted in weaker performance**. We leave as **future work to study ways to allow the model to have better generalization capabilities without the need for retraining**. Another limitation is that **our method does not consider all the degradations present in old recordings**. While the denoiser does a good job suppressing the additive disturbances and the BEHM-GAN reduces the bandwidth limitation, **many other distortion artifacts remain untreated and present in the signal**. **Further work needs to be done to design a more robust method that addresses these issues**.
